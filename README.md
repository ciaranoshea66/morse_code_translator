# morse_code_translator
Translator to and from Morse Code

This program was written as part of my portfolio creation - it is a basic script designed to allow translation into ans out of Morse Code.
1) Scrapes data from an open source site and creates a local .json file for offline usage if one doesn't already exist
2) Loads Morse dictionary from .json file
3) Takes an input of text to be translated
4) Determines whether the text is English or Morse
5) Undergoes translation
6) Prints return value and restarts translation process until user inputs "END"
